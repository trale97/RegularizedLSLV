## Description
The repository consists of accompanying codes for the Master's thesis of the Research Master in Social and Behavioral Science at Tilburg University. We developed the RLSLV method as an alternative for (exploratory) structural equation modeling in the high-dimensional data setting (small n, large p).
Here, you can find the **functions** developed in R to implement the method, the codes for the **Simulation Study** and **Empirical Data Analysis**.

The project is under construction. The final results will be updated here.
